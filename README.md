# Chess notation reader
Chess notation reader is a failed experiment in creating an app to convert chess games recorded by hand in notation books to digitally analysable games. 

OCR readers struggle to read human handwriting, but I had hoped that using a combination of photoprocessing and pattern matching, the simple lettering of chess notation could be read. I was unable to get recognition up above 50%, but hopefully OCR tech will improve in future and I can revisit this project.
